    Answering a user question on IRC doesn’t scale, only one person and
    a few lurkers will benefit from it. Answering a user question on a
    mailing list scales a little better, since the answer is archived
    and can be searched for. What really scales is instead to improve
    the reference manual. Yes, you know, documentation.
