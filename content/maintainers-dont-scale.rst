    At least for me, review isn’t just about ensuring good code quality,
    but also about diffusing knowledge and improving understanding. At
    first there’s maybe one person, the author (and that’s not a given),
    understanding the code. After good review there should be at least
    two people who fully understand it, including corner cases. And
    that’s also why I think that group maintainership is the only way to
    run any project with more than one regular contributor.
