A easy commandline tool for finding processes that are creating a
particular high load. I wanted to know what process creates the disk
load. Start `atop <http://www.atcomputing.nl/Tools/atop/>`__ and press
the key *d* and see the process that creates the high load. You see also
the bytes written and read by the process. With the key shortcut
*CTRL+Cursor key* you can see how high the data throughput is.
