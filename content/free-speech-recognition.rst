| I am working on a plugin for `KaDoSu <https://launchpad.net/kadosu>`__
  to index audio files. I found these three free libraries
  `Sphinx <http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/html/cmusphinx.php>`__,
  `ISIP <http://www.ece.msstate.edu/research/isip/projects/speech/index.html>`__
  and `Julius <http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php>`__ for speech
  recognition and decided to use Sphinx because it is a pure Java
  implementation and so I don't depend on natively compiled libraries.
  But all these libraries have the same problem. They need to be trained
  to recognize speech well. `Voxforge <http://www.voxforge.org/home>`__
  collects speech samples from its users and shares them for free with
  all these projects. Please donate your voice to get better free speech
  recognition.
