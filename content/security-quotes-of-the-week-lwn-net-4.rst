    In other words, because of pesky things like the Constitution in the
    United States and instead of just using existing, vast international
    resources to prosecute criminals and terrorists, we're going to be
    expanding broken ISP filters against the advice of pretty much
    everybody. Granted what is deemed "extremist" will likely be
    entirely arbitrary, and as we've seen with the porn filters, there's
    probably no limit to the number of entirely legal and legitimate
    websites UK citizens will find suddenly inaccessible.

    Billy Rios, director of threat intelligence at Qualys, here
    [Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit] today said he and colleague
    Terry McCorkle purchased a secondhand Rapiscan 522 B X-ray system
    via eBay and found several blatant security weaknesses that leave
    the equipment vulnerable to abuse: It runs on the outdated Windows
    98 operating system, stores user credentials in plain text, and
    includes a feature called Threat Image Projection used to train
    screeners by injecting .bmp images of contraband, such as a gun or
    knife, into a passenger carry-on in order to test the screener's
    reaction during training sessions. The weak logins could allow a bad
    guy to project phony images on the X-ray display.

    While much of the NSA's capabilities to locate someone in the real
    world by their network activity piggy-backs on corporate
    surveillance capabilities, there's a critical difference: False
    positives are much more expensive. If Google or Facebook get a
    physical location wrong, they show someone an ad for a restaurant
    they're nowhere near. If the NSA gets a physical location wrong,
    they call a drone strike on innocent people.

    — Bruce Schneier
