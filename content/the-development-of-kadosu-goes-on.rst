I started right now the porting of
`Kadosu <http://infram.wordpress.com/kadosu-categorized-document-search/>`__
to `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/>`__ 3.4. Important changes are

-  all the plugins are now collected in a feature,
-  `Lucene <http://lucene.apache.org/>`__ 2 API is used and
-  it is planned to move the project hosting to
   `launchpad.net <https://launchpad.net/>`__.
