    For the most common strength of Diffie-Hellman (1024 bits), it would
    cost a few hundred million dollars to build a machine, based on
    special purpose hardware, that would be able to crack one
    Diffie-Hellman prime every year.Would this be worth it for an
    intelligence agency? Since a handful of primes are so widely reused,
    the payoff, in terms of connections they could decrypt, would be
    enormous. Breaking a single, common 1024-bit prime would allow NSA
    to passively decrypt connections to two-thirds of VPNs and a quarter
    of all SSH servers globally. Breaking a second 1024-bit prime would
    allow passive eavesdropping on connections to nearly 20% of the top
    million HTTPS websites. In other words, a one-time investment in
    massive computation would make it possible to eavesdrop on trillions
    of encrypted connections.
