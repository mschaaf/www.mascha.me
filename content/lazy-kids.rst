| "If anything, today's computer users are less well adapted to dealing
  with applications that behave differently when the network is
  unexpectedly absent because both the user and the programmer assume
  that the network will be there because it always is. They would never
  set up a situation where the network would be missing and the programs
  they use/write are unlikely to handle the situation. Lazy kids."
