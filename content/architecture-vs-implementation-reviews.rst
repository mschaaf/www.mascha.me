`Architecture vs. Implementation
Reviews <http://www.arguingwithalgorithms.com/posts/14-12-02-architecture-reviews>`__.

Good article about the difference and necessity of differentiation
between architecture and implementation code review. With a nice
procedure how to do.

My preferred tool for reviewing my source code on github is
`gh-review <gh-review.herokuapp.com>`__.
