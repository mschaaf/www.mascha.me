| `Loggerhead in Launchpad <https://edge.launchpad.net/loggerhead>`__
| Loggerhead is a web viewer for projects in bazaar. It can be used to
  navigate a branch history, annotate files, view patches, perform
  searches, etc. It's originally based on bazaar-webserve, which is
  itself based on hgweb for Mercurial.
