I ended my thesis on 2008-05-05. The thesis has the title: "Integration
und Evaluation von Verfahren zur Bestimmung wahrscheinlicher Ursachen
des Scheiterns von Unit-Tests in Eclipse". It is written in german. But
there is a paper with the title "Towards Raising the Failure of Unit
Tests to the Level of Compiler-Reported Errors" (`in the book "Objects,
Components, Models and
Patterns" <http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/tools/tools46-2008.html>`__
or `for download only the paper as
pdf <http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/ps/pubs/TOOLS2008b.pdf>`__) which was
hold in July 2008 on the `Tools Europe 2008 <http://tools.ethz.ch>`__
conference which is in english and contains some of the material from my
thesis.
