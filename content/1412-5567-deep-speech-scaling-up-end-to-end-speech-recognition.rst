> We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed
> using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly
> simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously
> engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend
> to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our
> system does not need hand-designed components to model background
> noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly
> learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a
> phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our
> approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple
> GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow
> us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training.
> Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published
> results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0%
> error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging
> noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art
> commercial speech systems.
